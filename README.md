# LearnPython
Python Course GUL

I have written a Python program which can directly calculate DNA measurement parameters from user input. This is related to my actual work, where I normally use Excel for this task. 

This program is not inteded to replace Excel, however it can be the basis of a further development to also show a graph directly for instance. I saw this more as an exercise to get familiar with Python GUI programming, and believe that I have gained some good insights and can come back to this program when I want to use my knowledge again. Since I did not have a lot of programming experience before, this program is quite simple, but never the less I enjoyed working on it.
